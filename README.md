# replica-operator
k8s operator for controlling replica count during time

## Description
The operator watches for custom resources of a specific kind (e.g., `ReplicaControl`) in a designated namespace. These custom resources define the desired replica count at different points in time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the replica count of specified deployments.
- **Time-Based Control**: Define time intervals for scaling operations.
- **Configurability**: Easily configure the target deployments and scaling parameters.

## Prerequisites

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster with version 1.19 or later.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed.
- [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/install-operator-sdk/) installed.


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sadegh-msm/replica-operator.git
cd replica-operator
```

2. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```
3. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag
```

4. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! Please fork the repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
